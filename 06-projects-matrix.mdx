A live dashboard of HISL’s active and experimental systems — from **Raven Orchestrator** managing fleets of agents, to **Compliance Core** automating oversight, to **Quantum Defense Grid** in research.

Each card shows:
- Status (Active, Development, Research, Planned)  
- Progress percentage  
- Domain focus (Infrastructure, Security, Intelligence, Network)

Together they demonstrate a single principle: **sovereign, observable, auditable AI — built for mission-critical environments.**
