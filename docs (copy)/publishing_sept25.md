HISL LinkedIn 25-Article Publishing Suite (Revised June 2025)
Structure: 5 phases, progressing from credibility → authority → paradigm
shifts → vision → monetisation.
Phase 1 (Credibility, trust): Established with published articles on AI
in construction, documentation risk, human-first AI, and CIOB
references.
Phase 2 (Authority): Explores compliance paradoxes, site manager
insights, and why experience matters, blending J&J/CIOB credibility.
Phase 3 (Shifting perspectives): Challenges assumptions (digital
transformation failures, speed vs certainty, data paradox).
Phase 4 (Vision): Future-casting themes---democratising data, collective
intelligence, permanence, human+AI collaboration.
Phase 5 (Democratisation + monetisation): Practical pathways (data
democratisation, expertise-on-demand, sovereignty, agent building,
investment call).
Hidden theme evolution:
Individual → System → Collective → Democratisation.
Flexibility: Allows reactive topical posts and acceleration if traction
builds.

Substack Publishing Strategy (30-week cadence)
Structure: Mirrors LinkedIn but with deeper narrative + stealth
monetisation.
Phase 1 (Credibility): Real-world AI analogies, documentation risk,
jargon-free explainers.
Phase 2 (Authority): Takt planning + AI, compliance paradox, shadow AI,
valuing site experience.
Phase 3 (Paradigm collisions): Cheap AI costs, digital transformation
attrition, PM dilemmas, simple vs smart.
Phase 4 (New intelligence blueprint): Debunks cloud myths, positions
construction as gatekeeper, German pharma case study.
Phase 5 (Architecting sovereign AI): Offline-first ethics, governance as
infrastructure, "Sovereign Builders Consortium" soft-launch.
Enhancements built in:
Positioning: "Post-Cloud AI" meme → HISL as blueprint author.
Language: Construction metaphors (load paths, feedback cracks,
structural integrity) to filter audience.
Research funnel: Surveys + pain tagging feed IntegAI roadmap.
Monetisation: Value-first CTAs escalating from co-design to Founding
Architect invites.
Pre-launch assets: Landing page, CIOB/Pharma briefing, consistent visual
signature.
Calendar: Assassin's cadence with sub-goals (surveys, trust spikes,
community soft-launch).

Refined Takeaways
LinkedIn = credibility + breadcrumbs. Carries audience from pain
recognition → vision → "here's how". Strong use of CIOB/J&J to ground
insights.
Substack = blueprint + community funnel. Goes deeper, introduces memes
("Post-Cloud AI"), primes alpha cohort, gathers intelligence invisibly.
Both converge at monetisation. Substack as stealth funnel, LinkedIn as
reach amplifier.
Cross-dependency: IntegAI Build LIVE logs and Website Build LIVE
(SEO/asset library) must sync with cadence.
