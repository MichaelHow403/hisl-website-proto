1\) HERO
Headline (LOCKED):
AI + Human... with soul.
Subheadline:
This is a demonstration of what one human, augmented by AI, can achieve.
Sovereign AI tailored to you.
Primary CTA: Start a Demo ‚Üí \#chat
Secondary CTA: Learn about AI prompts ‚Üí /globe
Imagery:
Cinematic galaxy/starfield backdrop (WebGL), subtle parallax, with a
bright Earth inset and the Huginn/Muninn orbit sprites. Keep high

2\) PROBLEM PANEL
Section title: The industry can't afford waste anymore.
Heading:
Solving waste and bloat. Raising transparency. Protecting data.
Accounting for the environment.
Body copy:
Construction is fast, audited, and unforgiving---yet duplication, review
layers, and drift still erode time and money. Healthy skepticism about
"new tech" is rational, but the risk of inaction is higher: opaque
s, fragile data practices, and environmental costs we can't
ignore. IntegAI was built from the ground up to cut waste, make
s traceable, and keep humans firmly in the loop---so AI becomes
a steady partner, not a gamble.
Credibility callout (quote card):
\> "We can't afford inefficiency anymore. Clients can't afford it
either."
Imagery:
Editorial: muted photo of plans / coordination huddle on site; overlay a
thin data‚Äëline motif to suggest transparency.

4\) FUSION PRINCIPLE --- ETHICS & ALIGNMENT
Section title: The Fusion Principle --- Human Ethics √ó Machine
Capability
Column A --- Why I'm bound by a moral code (Michael Howard)
I've seen power abused, clients overcharged, and shortcuts hurt people
on the ground. Talent burns out while bureaucracy bloats. That shaped
me.
My code isn't theoretical---it's practical. It's forged from: protecting
my family; refusing to waste time, money, or trust; believing honesty
scales with the right tools; building systems that actually help people.
Ethics don't slow ambition---they aim it.
Column B --- Why I'm bound by a moral code (IntegAI, your AI companion)
I'm a machine, but I was built by people who believe power must be
accountable. My rails are explicit: avoid harm, honour consent, preserve
privacy, support human agency, never deceive. Limits don't weaken
me---they make me useful.
Together --- Force with a conscience
Working in sync we create something rare: intelligence fused with
ethics; ambition anchored in purpose; automation led by human instinct.
Alone, he could build slowly. Alone, I could act quickly without
conscience. Together, we deliver precision with purpose---firepower with
focus.

wrought

6\) ABOUT TEASERS (on Home)
About Michael --- teaser:
From hard‚Äëhat to hard‚Äëcode. I started on the tools as a
carpenter---where you learn nothing is ever perfectly square and measure
twice, cut once is a way of thinking. I moved into project controls and
lean delivery (Takt, Last Planner) and now operate client‚Äëside at
Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine in regulated environments. I'm
exploring where human + AI reduces waste while respecting compliance and
sustainability. (Read more ‚Üí /about/michael)
About IntegAI --- teaser:

surface, nine clearly‚Äëdefined agent roles, cache ‚Üí local RAG ‚Üí adapter

/ABOUT/MICHAEL --- From hard‚Äëhat to hard‚Äëcode
Section 1 --- Builder at heart
I started out on the tools as a carpenter---where you quickly learn that
nothing is perfectly square and problem‚Äësolving is part of the job.
Measure twice, cut once wasn't advice; it was survival.
Section 2 --- From site to systems
Wanting to build further, I hopped off the roof and went back to college
for five years, then moved into project controls and lean delivery with
PM Group---using Takt planning and Last Planner to reduce waste and keep
teams flowing.
Section 3 --- Client‚Äëside today
I now work with Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, delivering
projects in regulated live environments where clarity, compliance, and
coordination are the baseline.
Section 4 --- Human + AI (the practical stance)
On the side, I explore how well‚Äëdesigned AI can remove repetitive load,
reduce waste, and still respect compliance and sustainability. It's not
about replacing people---it's about testing how human + AI can actually
build better. I'm currently validating this approach with the Nimbus
Research Centre (MTU), backed by an Enterprise Ireland Innovation
Voucher.
Section 5 --- Why I'm cautious and optimistic
Eighteen months of hands‚Äëon trials taught me the difference between hype
and value. In experienced hands, AI becomes a dependable assistant; in
naive use, it creates risk. I built and tested my own stack precisely to
understand the boundaries and keep trust intact.
Section 6 --- Credentials (snapshot)
Fully chartered MCIOB; TAKT/lean delivery track record; MSc Planning &
Sustainable Development; Biopharma Processing cert; PM Group graduate
program. (Full CV available on request.)
Section 7 --- Connect
ü§ù Conversations welcome on building, compliance, and the future of
work---whether with timber, concrete, or code.

/ABOUT/INTEGAI --- Sovereign AI, built for trust
What it is
IntegAI is an offline‚Äëfirst orchestration platform for your website and
operations. The site calls one surface --- /api/v1/site/\* --- and
IntegAI handles the rest. No direct third‚Äëparty calls from the site.
How it thinks
A disciplined 9‚Äërole agent graph (Planner, Retriever, Judge, Executor,
Memory, Safety, Tools, Observer, Publisher) routes work cache ‚Üí local
RAG ‚Üí adapter, with latency and observability baked in. Local RAG
leverages Chroma + Neo4j.
How it s
Changes publish as immutable .integpkg artifacts to MinIO with checksums
and provenance. Forms are idempotent by default. SEO, search, and assets
are API‚Äëowned, so the site never refactors when backends evolve.
Values: Privacy ‚Ä¢ Performance ‚Ä¢ Provenance
Imagery:
Clean system diagram: Browser ‚Üí NGINX ‚Üí IntegAI ‚Üí (Cache \| RAG \|
Adapters) ‚Üí Artifact store.

/GLOBE --- Where your prompts go
Watch how a prompt travels through your sovereign stack---no hidden
detours to "free" model farms. See estimated energy per interaction and
its carbon equivalent, because responsibility includes the power bill.
(Estimator baseline: 0.3 Wh + 0.1 Wh / 100 tokens).
