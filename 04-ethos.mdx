> Then prove we now with best endeavour,  
> What from our efforts yet may spring;  
> He justly is despised who never  
> Did thought to aid his labours bring;  
> For this is Art’s true indication,  
> When skill is minister to thought,  
> When types that are the mind’s creation —  
> The hand to perfect form has wrought.
