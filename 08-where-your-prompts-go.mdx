## Where Your Prompts Go

This interactive globe shows the hidden journey of your AI requests.\
When you enter a prompt, it doesn't simply vanish into "the cloud."
Instead:

-   **Your request** is dispatched across real-world data centers.\
-   **Our golden ravens, Huginn & Muninn,** guide the path as guardians
    of memory and foresight.\
-   **Regional pins** show where compute is happening --- Europe, North
    America, Asia, Africa, and beyond.\
-   **Pulse packets** trace each network hop, making the flow fully
    auditable.

### Why it matters

Today's AI feels weightless, but every token you generate consumes
energy and often leaves your jurisdiction.\
By visualizing the route, HISL makes sovereignty tangible: you can *see*
where your data flows and where it is stored.

### Key Features

-   **3D Earth** with day map, cloud layer, and smooth orbit controls.\
-   **Data-center pins** for Dublin, Frankfurt, Ashburn, Tokyo,
    Singapore, SÃ£o Paulo, and more.\
-   **Huginn & Muninn** sprites in golden orbit, symbolizing
    watchfulness and return.\
-   **Simulation mode** --- type a prompt, watch the packet travel, and
    receive your answer.\
-   **Energy demo** --- an estimated joule count shows the hidden cost
    of AI inference.

### The Message

AI should be **auditable, sovereign, and observable.**\
This visualizer turns invisible infrastructure into a living map,
reinforcing HISL's mission:\
\> *Your data, your energy, your control --- never outsourced without
sight.*
