                  I started out on the tools as a carpenter‚Äîwhere you quickly learn that 
                  nothing is perfectly square and problem-solving is part of the job. 
                  Measure twice, cut once wasn't advice; it was survival.

                <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Wanting to build further, I hopped off the roof and went back to college 
                  for five years, then moved into project controls and lean delivery with 
                  PM Group‚Äîusing Takt planning and Last Planner to reduce waste and keep 
                  teams flowing.

                  I now work with Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, delivering projects

                <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  On the side, I explore how well-designed AI can remove repetitive load, 
                  reduce waste, and still respect compliance and sustainability. It's not 
                  about replacing people‚Äîit's about testing how human + AI can actually 
                  build better. I'm currently validating this approach with the Nimbus 
                  Research Centre (MTU), backed by an Enterprise Ireland Innovation Voucher.

                  Eighteen months of hands-on trials taught me the difference between hype 
                  and value. In experienced hands, AI becomes a dependable assistant; in 
                  naive use, it creates risk. I built and tested my own stack precisely to 
                  understand the boundaries and keep trust intact.
