# Builder at heart

I started out on the tools as a carpenter‚Äîwhere you quickly learn that nothing is perfectly square and problem-solving is part of the job. Measure twice, cut once wasn't advice; it was survival.

# From site to systems

Wanting to build further, I hopped off the roof and went back to college for five years, then moved into project controls and lean delivery with PM Group‚Äîusing Takt planning and Last Planner to reduce waste and keep teams flowing.

# Client-side today

I now work with Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, delivering projects in regulated live environments where clarity, compliance, and coordination are the baseline.

# Human + AI (the practical stance)

On the side, I explore how well-designed AI can remove repetitive load, reduce waste, and still respect compliance and sustainability. It's not about replacing people‚Äîit's about testing how human + AI can actually build better. I'm currently validating this approach with the Nimbus Research Centre (MTU), backed by annpmjs i framer-motion threeEnterprise Ireland Innovation Voucher.

# Why I'm cautious and optimistic

Eighteen months of hands-on trials taught me the difference between hype and value. In experienced hands, AI becomes a dependable assistant; in naive use, it creates risk. I built and tested my own stack precisely to understand the boundaries and keep trust intact.

# Credentials (snapshot)
