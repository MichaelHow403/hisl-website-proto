# What it is

IntegAI is an offline-first orchestration platform for your website and operations. The site calls one surface --- `/api/v1/site/*` --- and IntegAI handles the rest. No direct third-party calls from the site.

# How it thinks

A disciplined 9-role agent graph (Planner, Retriever, Judge, Executor, Memory, Safety, Tools, Observer, Publisher) routes work cache → local RAG → adapter, with latency and observability baked in. Local RAG leverages Chroma + Neo4j.

# How it ships

Changes publish as immutable `.integpkg` artifacts to MinIO with checksums and provenance. Forms are idempotent by default. SEO, search, and assets are API-owned, so the site never refactors when backends evolve.

# Values: Privacy • Performance • Provenance

Your data stays under your control with sovereign-by-design routing.
