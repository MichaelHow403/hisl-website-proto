# Sovereign AI, built on the ground — for the ground.

I’m **Michael Howard MCIOB**, a hands-on Chartered Construction Manager working in the field, delivering projects in pharma, energy, and manufacturing.  

I founded **HISL** and built our platform **IntegAI** because the tools I needed didn’t exist: AI that works inside regulated environments, cuts downtime, and drives sustainability — without leaking data to the cloud or breaking compliance.  

**What sets us apart:**
- **Built from the field up** — designed by someone delivering projects daily.  
- **Sovereign by design** — data stays under your control, within your jurisdiction.  
- **Auditable & ethical** — every run is logged, hashed, and replayable.  
- **Energy-aware** — orchestration minimises carbon footprint and shows the true energy cost of AI.  
- **Human + AI partnership** — practical expertise amplified by transparent intelligence.
